### Initial Project Structure
# Backend/Frontend folder for scaling the website

# Getting Started with the Frontend
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Navigate into the frontend directory:
cd frontend -> npm install -> npm run dev

Additional Scripts
Here are other useful commands that you can run in the frontend directory:
npm run start
or
npm run lint  (to check for code formatting and potential errors)

# Deployment (Vercel)
The project is optimized for deployment using Vercel. Once your frontend is ready for production:
  1. Deploy to Vercel: Follow Vercel's deployment documentation to deploy the Next.js app directly from GitHub.
  2. Check your live site: After deployment, Vercel will provide a live URL for the application.
